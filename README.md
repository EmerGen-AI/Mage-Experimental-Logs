# Mage: Cracking Elliptic Curve Cryptography with Cross-Axis Transformers
[See the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12483.pdf)

This repository contains the logs for my ablation tests of the Mage paper.

Although it's not much to look at, this is the extent of the data that we are willing to open-source with regard to our experiment.

We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
